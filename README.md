# PasswordGenerator

This webpage contains a password generator that runs through javascript. Using event listeners and alerts, the site will ask for which criteria the user would like to use. There is an added feature that confirms and redirects users when the wrong data is submitted. The page then uses random numbers to generate a random password with the selected criteria.

## Installation

    To install, download the whole folder and open the file named index.html.

## Usage

The perfect tool for people who frequently require new and different passwords. This saves time and creates a random password every time. The level of complexity the user can make for these passwords can provide more security than coming up with something on your own that is easier to guess.
